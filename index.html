          <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>
          <p>
            As a Computer Science undergraduate at the <span>University of Delhi</span>, I've cultivated a profound interest in the dynamic interplay between technology and security. My academic journey has led me to immerse myself in the captivating realms of cybersecurity and quantum computing. The potential of quantum computing to revolutionize problem-solving and computation, while also posing significant security challenges, has captivated my attention. I am driven by a compelling desire to understand the intricate challenges posed to our digital world and to develop innovative solutions that safeguard our future.
            <br><br>
            My initial foray into the tech landscape was through web development, where I honed my problem-solving abilities and acquired a solid foundation in crafting engaging digital experiences. These experiences ignited a passion for building robust and user-centric applications. Additionally, I have had the opportunity to serve as the Tech Lead for the GDSC community at my college. In this role, I have cultivated a collaborative and inspiring environment for fellow tech enthusiasts, fostering knowledge sharing and project development.
            <br><br>
            With a strong foundation in Python and C++, I am continually seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and contribute to cutting-edge projects. I am particularly drawn to the challenges presented by emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, and their potential to revolutionize various industries. Moreover, I am eager to explore the possibilities offered by quantum computing and its applications in fields like cryptography, optimization, and materials science. Ultimately, I aspire to become a skilled cybersecurity professional capable of defending against evolving threats and shaping a secure digital future.
